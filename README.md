# e-commerce

## Description
This application allows you to create new products to help identify them easier using API routes. Using Insomnia, we were able to use several API routes to efficiently organize and tag products, allowing better categorization. 
Routes in this application allow users to interact with different features such as creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving categories, products, and tags.
